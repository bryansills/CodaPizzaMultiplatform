# Coda Pizza

A Kotlin multiplatform project (Android and JVM) building on top of the final project in Big Nerd Ranch's Android guide.

## Running the app

Assuming you have the tools to run an Android app, getting this app running on both platforms is relatively straightforward.
The Android app can be run using the standard Gradle tasks or the tooling within Android Studio.
In order to run the desktop JVM app, run the following Gradle command:

```shell
$ ./gradlew :desktop:run
```

## So you want to give me a job...

Companies love to give coding assignments to people when they are interviewing for jobs and I've done my fair share.
Here are a few projects of mine that I think do a good job of showing off my technical skills as an Android developer:

- [Photo Gallery](https://github.com/bryansills/Photo-Gallery): A Flickr client. Based on a project in the 5th edition of Big Nerd Ranch's Android guide (which I wrote), this Jetpack Compose implementation shows off infinite paging and clean unit tests.
- [Loud Ping](https://github.com/bryansills/LoudPing/): An unwieldy side project of mine trying to help me have a better relationship with the music I listen to. The UI side of things may be a bit basic, but I'm doing a lot of neat things in the Gradle world and one of my more thoroughly architected apps.
- [AllTrails](https://github.com/bryansills/AllTrails): An app to search for nearby restaurants to have lunch. The best app for showing off my UI skills.
- [Coda Pizza Multiplatform](https://github.com/bryansills/CodaPizzaMultiplatform) (this project): A multiplatform pizza customizing app. Based on a project in the 5th edition of Big Nerd Ranch's Android guide (which I wrote), I wrote and presented this Kotlin multiplatform app as a codelab at KotlinConf 2023 in Amsterdam.
